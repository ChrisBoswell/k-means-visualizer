# K Means Visualizer
Simple 2D visualization for the k-means clustering algorithm


# What is K-Means?
K-Means is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used to cluster data into groups. The algorithm works by initally randomly grouping the data points, then iteratively improving the error.

## Setup

Run `pip install pygame`.

## Usage

You will be prompted to choose the number of data points, clusters and then the speed at which you would like the algorithm to progess.
